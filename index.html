            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>Everything to me is a puzzle to be solved. From strategy games to Brazilian Jiu Jitsu to coding, I strive to maximize the efficiency of anything I create. 
            That is why I strive to become a backend engineer -- there is so much to optimize, between data collection, application security, minimizing unnecessary 
            re-calculations, and UI reactivity. My current goal is to grow my skills in these fields of expertise so I can perform the job to the best of my ability
            as a problem-solver.</p>

                                <li>Designed an accounting application (R Shiny) with automated matching functionality under certain conditions, and allows the user to manually match records with one click before writing the matched records to a database. Saved the users approx. 10 hours per week of manual matching and checking records.
                                </li>
                                <li>Edited an application (R Shiny) that users use to resample quality metrics data, including fixing seven different filters, download functionality, and creating the ability to toggle showing data that has already been sampled. Currently in use by approximately 10 users who track quality metrics.
                                </li>
                                <li>Updated Tableau dashboard to include error tracking metrics that count the distinct records per month, conditionally calculate client financial impact, and filter records below the graph by clicking on the graph.
                                </li>

                                <li>Coded a recommendation algorithm (Python) that recommends the statistically most popular product class that a user does not already have. Packaged the function into a Sklearn class to be streamlined with other functions. The recommendation algorithm is still in development.
                                </li>
                                <li>Implemented a recommendation algorithm (Python) that uses truncated singular value decomposition to “smooth” preferences from a filler probability value to an approximate probability value. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Presented and added graphs (Python) to documentation demonstrating the logic used in every step of the recommendation system, and justification for each decision
